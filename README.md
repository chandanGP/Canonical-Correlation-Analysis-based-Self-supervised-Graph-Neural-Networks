This is the implimentation of the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12484
* In main.py we run models for all datasets
* In main_adaptive_augmentation.py we run models with adaptive augmentation
* datasets used are co-author py, co-author cs , amazon photos, amazon computers , cora , citeseer, pubmed all datasets are available in pytorch_geometric
